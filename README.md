# Hi, I'm Jehaad ‚Äî Full-Stack Developer

I design and develop software solutions with a focus on scalability, reliability, and clean, maintainable code. With experience across frontend, backend, and cross-platform development, I work with modern technologies such as React, Next.js, TypeScript, Convex, and more to deliver high-quality applications.

I have worked on projects ranging from web platforms and mobile apps to real-time systems, always aiming to create solutions that are efficient and user-friendly. I enjoy solving complex problems, exploring new tools, and collaborating with others to bring ideas to life.
